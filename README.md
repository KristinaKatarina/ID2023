# Algorithm for predicting diabetes based on lifestyle factors.

Authors: Kristina Katarina Kaljum√§e, Karen Roht

Objectives:
1. Create a reasonably accurate machine learning algorithm that can predict how likely a person is to be diabetic based on their lifestyle factors.
2. Find out what are the primary factors that contribute to a person being diabetic.

A guide to the contents of this repository: <br>
<br>
In this repository, there are two datasets and one notebook. The dataset 'diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv' contains the original data that we obtained from Kaggle. The second dataset 'balanced_data.csv' is a dataset that we created by balancing and removing a few columns from 'diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv'. The notebook has all the code that we used to create our model.<br>

How to replicate the same analysis: <br>
<br>
The analysis can be replicated by cloning this repository and running the notebook.
